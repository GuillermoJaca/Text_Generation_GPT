# Text_Generation_GPT

This project started when I was looking for a present for my little cousin. She is crazy about Peppa Pig and has already watched all chapters. Then it came to my head that maybe I could create a model that would generate episodes of Peppa Pig automatically. Therefore, as an example of a custom dataset, we will use Pepa Pig episodes.
For better comprehension, the project will be divided as follows:

  -Data Collection and Data Cleaning
  
  -Train/Test Split and Tokenization
  
  -Model Finetuning and Generation
